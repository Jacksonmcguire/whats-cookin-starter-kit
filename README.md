## What's Cooking?


### User:
#### Each user has a pantry in which they store their ingredients.  They have access to a number of recipes and may add them to either their favorites or a list of planned meals.  As a user you may cook a meal if you have the required ingredients.  This will remove the items from your pantry.  

#### 1. Take a look around in the cookbook and if you think you may like a recipe, click on it's star at the top right to favorite it. At any point inside or outside of your favorites tab you may unfavorite it.

#### 2. Clicking on a recipe will bring it into a feature box where you may see it's Ingredients, any ingredients that may be missing out of your cupboard, and the instructions to follow when cooking.

#### 3. From the feature window, Clicking 'Add to my Planned Recipes" button will add this recipe to your list of planned recipes for the week. At any point you may remove the recipe with the "Remove from my Planned Recipes" button.

#### 4. To view your Planned Recipes, click the "Planned Recipes" button in your User menu at the top left. 

#### 5. To view your Favorite Recipes, click the "Favorites" button in your User menu at the top left.

#### 6.  To cook a meal, when you have it chosen as a feature and are ready to follow the instructions, click the "Cook" button at the top left of the feature window.  This will ensure that your pantry is updated to the proper amounts of ingredients.
